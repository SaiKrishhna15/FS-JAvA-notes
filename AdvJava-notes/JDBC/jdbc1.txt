JDBC
=====
As of now it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is known as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store in a RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making application writing a data in a file or database software.

File and database software act like a permanent storage device or medium.

Persistence 
===========
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


Important Terminologies
=======================

1) Persistence store
-------------------
	It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long period of time.
	ex:
		Files 
		Database S/W  

2) Persistence data 
------------------
	Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
	ex:
		Records 
		Tables

3) Persistence operation
----------------------
	Create, update, delete, insert, select and etc are called persistence operations.
	In realtime this operation is also known as CURD operation, CRUD operation or SCUD operation.
	ex:				
		C - create 		S - select 
		U - update		C - create
		R - read 		U - update 
		D - delete 		D - delete 

4) Persistence logic 
-------------------
	A logic which is capable to perform persistence operations is called persistence logic.
	ex:
		IOStream 
		JDBC Code 
		Hibernate Code 
		
5) Persistence technology 	
-------------------------
	A technology which is used to develop persitence logics is called persistence technology.
	ex:
		JDBC
		Hibernate 
		IBatis 
		and etc.


Q) What is JDBC ?

JDBC is a persistence technology that is used to develop persistence logics having the capability 
to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.

Note:
-----
					IOStream 
	JavaApp		-------------------------------------------	  Files 
				Serialization/Deserialization


					JDBC Code 
	JavaApp		-------------------------------------------	  Database S/W 

Limitations with File as a persistence store 
============================================

> It stores limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not allow us to apply constraints.

> It does not show an application with relationship.

> Updation and deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.


Advantages of database as a persistence store 
==============================================

> It stores unlimited amount of data.

> It provides security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is possible.

> It supports common query language.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> It shows an application with relationships.

> Updation and deletion of a data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.

Every JDBC application is a two-tier application. Where java with JDBC code acts like a frontend/tier1/layer1
and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2.

Enduser is a non-technical person. He can't prepare and execute SQL query in database softare. He 
depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work for them.

JDBC Driver 
===========
JDBC driver acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

It is used to convert java instructions to database instructions and vice versa.

Diagram: jdbc1.2


ODBC Driver 
===========
VBscript, Perl, D2K and etc uses ODBC driver to locate and interact with database software.

Diagram: jdbc1.3
 

ODBC driver developed in C language by taking the support of pointers.

But java does not support pointers. To overcome this limitation Sun Micro System introduced JDBC 
drivers exclusively.



Q) How many drivers are there in JDBC?

We have four JDBC Drivers.

1) Type1 JDBC driver / JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver 

2) Type2 JDBC driver / Native API driver 

3) Type3 JDBC driver / Net Protocol driver 

4) Type4 JDBC driver / Native Protocol driver 



Q) What is JDBC?

JDBC is a open technology given by Sun Micro System having set of rules and guidelines to develop
jdbc drivers to interact with multiple database softwares.
