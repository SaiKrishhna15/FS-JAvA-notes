Web Application 
================
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1) Static web page / Passive web page 
-------------------------------------
	A web page with fixed content is called static web page.
	ex:
		Home page 
		About page 
		Contact page 
		Facebook login page 
		and etc.

2) Dynamic web page / Active web page 
------------------------------------
	A web page with dynamic content is called dynamic web page.
	ex:
		live cricket score page 
		stock market share value page 
		news page 
		and etc.	

We have two types of web resource programs.

1) Static web resource program 
------------------------------
A static web resource program is used to develop static web pages.
ex:
 	HTML program
	CSS program 
	Bootstrap program 
	Angularjs program 
	Reactjs program 
	and etc.

2) Dynamic web resource program 
--------------------------------
A dynamic web resource program is used to develop dynamic web pages.
ex:
	Servlet program 
	JSP program 
	and etc.

Based on the position and execution web resource programs are divided into two types.

1) Client side web resource program 
-------------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at client side (browser window) is called client side web resource program.

All static web resource programs are called client side web resource programs.

ex:
	HTML program , CSS program, Bootstrap program, Angularjs program and etc.



2) Server side web resource program 
-------------------------------------
A web resource program which executes at server side is called server side web resource program.

All dynamic web resource programs are called server side web resource programs.

ex:
	servlet program, jsp program and etc.

Web application and web resource program execution 
==================================================
Java application executes manually.

Web application and web resource program will execute at the time when they have requested.

Diagram: servlet1.2

With respect to the diagram:

1) Enduser gives the request to web resource program.

2) Web server traps that request and passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

3) Web resource program executes the logic to process the request.

4) Web resource program communicates with database software if neccessary.

5) Web resource program gives the result to web server.

6) Web server sends the output to browser window as dynamic web page.

Note:
---
	The process of keeping the web application in a server is called deployment and reverse 
	is called undeployment.

Web Server 
==========
A server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

ex:
	Tomcat, Resin and etc.

Responsibilities of web server
-------------------------------
> It takes continues request from client.

> It passes that request to appropriate web resource program.

> It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web applications.

> It adds middleware services only to deployed web applications.

> It provides environment to execute client side web resource program in browser window.

> It takes the result/output from web resource program.

> It sends the output to browser window as dynamic response.

> It is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program execution.

Note:
----
	To execute java program we required JRE/JVM.
	
	To execute servlet program we required servlet container.

	To execute JSP program we required JSP container.

Web Container 
=============
A web container is a software application or a program which is used to manage whole life cycle of web resource program i.e from birth to death.

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

JSP container manage whole life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry considers servlet container and JSP container are web containers.

Every server is designed to support servlet container and JSP container.
