Main method 
=============
Our program contains main method or not. Either it is properly declared or not. It is not a responsibility of a compiler to check. It is a liability of a JVM to check for main method always at  runtime. If JVM won't find main method then it will throw one runtime error called main method not found.

JVM always look for main method with following signature.
ex:
	public static void main(String[] args)

If we perform any changes in above signature then JVM will throw one runtime error called main method not found.


Q) Explain main method in java?

public 
------
	JVM wants to call main method from anywhere.

static 
------
	JVM wants to call main method without using object reference.

void 
-----
	Main method does not return anything to JVM.

main
-----
	It is an identifier given to a main method.

String[] args
------------
	It is a command line argument.


We can perform following changes in main method.

1) Order of modifiers is not important incase of public static we can declare static public also.
   ex:
	static public void main(String[] args)

2) We can replace String[] in following acceptable formats.
   ex:
	public static void main(String[] args)
	public static void main(String   []args)
	public static void main(String args[])
	

3) We can replace args with any java valid identifier.
   ex:
	public static void main(String[] ihub)


4) We can change String[] with var-arg parameter.
   ex:
	public static void main(String... args)

5) Main method will accept following modifiers.
   ex:
	synchronized, strictfp, final
