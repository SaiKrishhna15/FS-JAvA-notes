Flavours in Java
=================
We have three flavours in java.


					JAVA
	|--------------------------------|---------------------------------|
	JSE/J2SE			JEE/J2EE			JME/J2ME
(Java Standard Edition)		(Java Enterprise Edition)	(Java Micro Edition)

> Standalone app 		> Distributed app 		> Mobile app

> Desktop app 			> Enterprise app 

> Two-tier app 			> ERP app 

				> N-tier app 


> Standalone app 
-----------------
A normal java program which contains main method is called standlone application.
ex:
	class Test
	{
		public static void main(String[] args)
		{
			-
			- //code to be execute
			-
		}
	}

> Desktop app
--------------
It is a software application which is specially designed to perform perticular task.
ex:
	Control Panel 
	Recycle Bin 
	and etc.
	

> Two-tier app
---------------
Having more then one tier is called two-tier application.

> Distributed app 
-----------------
Diagram: class2.3

In client/server application if multiple request goes to main server then main server will distribute those request to it's parallel servers to reduce the burdun of main server such type of application is called distributed application.



> Enterprise app
----------------
An application which deals with large business complex logic with the help of middleware services is called enterprise application.

Here middleware services means authentication, autherization, malware production, security and etc.

ex:
	Facebook
	Online shopping websites 
	and etc. 


> ERP app 
---------
ERP stands for Enterprise Resource Planning.

It is used to maintain the data in a enterprise.

> N-tier app 
-----------
Having more then two tiers is called N-tier application.


> Mobile app
-------------
It is a software application or a program which is designed for wireless network devices like phone, cell, tab, cellular and etc rather then laptop's and PC's.

ex:
	Gpay 
	PubG 
	Instagram 
	and etc.

JME flavour is outdated in java because to develop mobile applications we got many alternate technologies like Andriod, React Native, Flutter, Swift programming and etc.
