Naming Conventions in java
==========================
In java, uppercase letters will consider as different and lowercase letters will consider as different. Hence we consider java is a case sensitive programming language.

As java is a case sensitive, we must and should follow naming conventions for following things.

ex:
	classes 
	interfaces
	variables 
	methods
	keywords
	packages
	constants 

classes 
--------
In java, a class name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined classes		userdefined classes
	------------------		-------------------
	System 				Test
	FileWriter 			TestApp 
	BufferedReader 			DemoApp
	StringBuffer 			ExampleProgram
	and etc.			and etc.

interfaces
----------
In java, an interface name must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined interfaces		userdefined interfaces
	--------------------		----------------------
	Runnable 			ITest
	Serializable			IDemoApp 
	ListIterator 			ITestApp
	Comparator 			IExampleApp
	and etc.			and etc.


variables
----------
In java, a variable name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined variables		userdefined variables
	-------------------		----------------------
	length 				empId
	out				studName
	err 				deptNo
	in 				tutionFee
	and etc.			and etc.

methods
---------
In java, a method name must and should starts with lowercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined methods		userdefined methods
	------------------		--------------------
	getClass()			getDetails()
	hashCode()			setInfo()
	toString()			caculateBillAmt()
	getPriority()			fetchStudentInfo()
	setName()			and etc.
	and etc.	


keywords
---------
In java, all keywords we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined keywords 
	-------------------
	class, public, void , static, if , else, do , for, switch and etc.

packages
----------
In java, all packages we need to declare under lowercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined packages		userdefined packages
	--------------------		-------------------
	java.lang			com.ihub.www
	java.io				com.google.www
	java.util			com.qt.www
	java.util.stream 		and etc.
	java.time 
	java.text 
	java.sql 
	and etc.

constants 
-----------
In java, constants we need to declare under uppercase letters only.

ex:
	predefined constants 		userdefined constants
	-------------------		---------------------
	MAX_PRIORITY 			N=10;
	NORM_PRIORITY 			LIMIT=40;
	MIN_PRIORITY 			and etc.
	MAX_VALUE 
	MIN_VALUE 
	and etc.

Interview Question
==================

Q) Which package consider as default package in java?

	java.lang package 



Q) What is the difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?

JDK
----
JDK stands for Java Development Kit.

It is a installable software which consist Java Runtime Environment (JRE), Java Virtual Machine (JVM), compiler (javac), interpreter (java), an archiever (.jar), document generator (javadoc) and other tools need for java application development.

JRE 
----
JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
It provides very good environment to run java applications only.

JVM
----
JVM is an interpreter which is used to execute our program line by line procedure.
